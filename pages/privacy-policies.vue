          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if
            this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
            has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store
            your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
            until deletion is possible.
          </p>

          <p>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

          <p>
            In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
            system of organizational and technical security measures.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational
            security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
            information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot
            guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will
            do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
            personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.
            You should only access the services within a secure environment.
          </p>

          <p>10. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>

          <p>
            In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to
            children under 18 years of age.
          </p>

          <p>
            We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
            years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at
            least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
            consent to such minor dependent&rsquo;s use of the Services. If we
            learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age
            has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take
            reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.
            If you become aware of any data we have collected from children
            under age 18, please contact us at privacy@theopenstories.com.

          <p>11. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

          <p>
            In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you
            have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your
            personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your
            account at any time.
          </p>

          <p>
            In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain
            rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the
            right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
            information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to
            restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if
            applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may
            also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
            information. To make such a request, please use the contact details
            provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in
            accordance with applicable data protection laws.

          <p>
            If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
            information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any
            time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness
            of the processing before its withdrawal.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we
            are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have
            the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory
            authority. You can find their contact details here:

          <p>12. DATA BREACH</p>

          <p>
            A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or
            collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You
            will be notified about data breaches when Termly LLC believes you
            are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach
            may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your
            mental or physical well-being. In the event that Termly LLC becomes
            aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in
            unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information
            Termly LLC will promptly investigate the matter and notify the
            applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after
            having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is
            unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
            persons.
          </p>

          <p>13. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;) feature or
            setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
            have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
            collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this privacy policy.
          </p>

          <p></p>

            compliant with relevant laws.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated
            version will be indicated by an updated &ldquo;Revised&rdquo; date
            and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is
            accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we
            may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such
            changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you
            to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we
            are protecting your information.
